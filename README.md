# QuartzJS

Simple library of fancy and funny functions to write code like you were speaking. :bowtie:

I started **Quartz** as a project where I could put in practice all I've been learning in JavaScript and coding in general. Here I re-invented the wheel using Functional Programing and taking the syntax from test frameworks like Mocha or Jasmin. I was looking for a way to make my code more readible without undertanding the logic behind the algorithms.

What I'm trying to get with this is a better way to write code explaining **What** are the code is doing and not **How**. Sometimes you've got crazy logic and for new developers, or sombody that is just getting into your project, might be difficult to understand. This cause a waste of time asking and reading the documentation of the code _(if there's any comment)_ :sweat_smile:

Quarts is divided in three dependencies: **is**, **has**, and **tools**. If you are interested in know more about Quartz visit: https://dracotmolver.github.io/quartz-js/.

Any feedback is wellcome!.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did coding it :heart:
