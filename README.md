A simple library with some fancy and funny functions to write code like you were speaking. :bowtie:

I started **Quartz** as a project where I could put in practice all I've been learning in JavaScript and coding in general. Here I reinvented the wheel using Functional Programing and taking the syntax from testing frameworks like Mocha or Jasmine. I was looking for a way to make my code more readable without undertanding the logic behind the algorithms, somthing more human.

What I'm trying to get with this is a differnt way to write code explaining **What** the code is doing and not **How**. Sometimes you've got crazy logic and for new developers, or sombody that is just getting into your project, it might be difficult to understand the code. This causes a waste of time asking and reading the documentation of the code _(if there's any comment)_ :sweat_smile:
